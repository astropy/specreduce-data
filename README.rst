This repository contains general reference and calibration data for spectroscopic data reduction
(e.g. standard star spectra, atmospheric extinction curves, line lists for calibration
lamps).

We love contributions! specreduce-data is open source and we would appreciate any
new data or updates to existing data. Much of the data archived here comes from the
calibration data that IRAF provides. This has been augmented with some more recent data that's
freely available from other sources. A goal of this repository is to provide a single,
curated collection to help save users the task of finding and downloading calibration
reference data themselves.
