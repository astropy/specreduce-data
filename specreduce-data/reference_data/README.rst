Reference Data Directory
========================

This directory contains general-purpose reference data files for use in spectroscopic
data reduction. Its primary purpose is to support the specreduce package, but the data
can be used on its own. In fact, a significant amount of this data came originally from
IRAF. See README files within the directories and comments in the files for details
on data provenance and literature references.

Note that this is intended only for relatively small files that are infrequently updated.
- large or frequently updated files should be externally hosted and downloaded as needed.
