Reference Data Directory
========================

This directory contains general-purpose reference data files for use in spectroscopic
data reduction. Its primary purpose is to support the specreduce package, but the data
can be used on its own. In fact, a significant amount of this data came originally from
IRAF. See README files within the directories and comments in the files for details
on data provenance and literature references.
